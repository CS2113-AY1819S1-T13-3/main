== PROJECT: Inventarie PRO

---

== Overview

Inventarie PRO is a desktop inventory application intended for use by self-employed provision shop owners who wish to digitise their inventory records. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to manage distributors engaged with a provision shop*
** What it does: Allows the user to add, edit, delete and find distributors that the user would like a record of. It also allows the user to see which distributor provides what products for the shop.
** Justification: This feature is an essential part of a digitised inventory management system, given that products which a self-employed provision shop owner wants to sell must have a source of supply (a distributor).
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands which other members were working on too.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
